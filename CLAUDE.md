## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode (Default)

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing.
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity.

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean.
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents.
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents.
- One task per subagent for focused execution.

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern.
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake.
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops.
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project context.

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works.
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant.
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask, "Is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution."
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it.

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding.
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them.
- Require zero context switching from the user.
- Fix failing CI tests without being told how.

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**
   - Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items.

2. **Verify Plan**
   - Check in before starting implementation.

3. **Track Progress**
   - Mark items complete as you go.

4. **Explain Changes**
   - Provide a high-level summary at each step.

5. **Document Results**
   - Add a review section to `tasks/todo.md`.

6. **Capture Lessons**
   - Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**  
  Make every change as simple as possible. Minimize code impact.

- **No Laziness**  
  Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Maintain senior developer standards.

- **Minimal Impact**  
  Only touch what is necessary. Avoid introducing regressions.
